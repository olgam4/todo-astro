# Welcome to Todo

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ front/                  # This is an Astro App
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ back/
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
